			<div class="lower-row">Each room can hold a maximum of 2 guests, and has its own en-suite. We pride ourselves on creating beautiful spaces for guests to relax and unwind. We have a communal lounge area where guests can relax and read a newspaper, interact with other guests staying at the lodge or simply sit and enjoy the spectacular views. Breakfast and dinner are provided for guests each evening and there is a communal dining area where guests can enjoy their meals beside the comfort of an open fire. There are still some spaces available to stay in December.</div>
