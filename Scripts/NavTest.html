		<h1>WELCOME TO JUNE LIVING INTERIORS</h1>
			<div class="middle-row-upper">
				Welcome to Clifden Seaview Lodge. We are an award-winning lodge overlooking the Wild Atlantic Way. Built in 1880, the lodge is nestled into the beautiful Irish landscape and boasts incredible views of the Atlantic Ocean. It is situated on Connemara's infamous 'Sky Road' and is close to some of Galway's most spectacular amenities. Whether you're a couple looking for a weekend escape or a family looking to enjoy some of what Connemara has to offer, the Clifden Seaview Lodge is sure not to disappoint.
			</div>

			<div class="middle-row-upper">
				The lodge has been previously described by guests as being a 'great escape' and a haven for getting away from the hustle and bustle of busy life. The beach is a 2 minute walk from the lodge, and there are some fantastic walks nearby including the infamous 'Clifden Nature Trail'. We offer 5 boutique rooms, each with their own unique views of the beautiful Irish landscape and ocean. We look forward to welcoming you.

			<div class="lower-row">Each room can hold a maximum of 2 guests, and has its own en-suite. We pride ourselves on creating beautiful spaces for guests to relax and unwind. We have a communal lounge area where guests can relax and read a newspaper, interact with other guests staying at the lodge or simply sit and enjoy the spectacular views. Breakfast and dinner are provided for guests each evening and there is a communal dining area where guests can enjoy their meals beside the comfort of an open fire. There are still some spaces available to stay in December.</div>
